# Copilot Adoption Intelligence System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an AI‑driven Copilot Adoption Intelligence System designed to evaluate organizational readiness, adoption likelihood, and productivity impact of GenAI tools.
The system combines machine learning, sentiment analysis, and business rule logic to support data‑driven decision‑making for enterprise AI adoption.


## 🎯 Objectives

1. Predict the likelihood of successful Copilot adoption within an organization
2. Estimate the expected productivity impact of GenAI usage
3. Analyze employee sentiment toward Copilot adoption
4. Provide actionable recommendations to improve adoption outcomes


## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The system uses two Random Forest models:

1. Classification Model to predict high vs low adoption likelihood
2. Regression Model to estimate productivity change

Class imbalance is addressed using Random Under Sampling, ensuring fair and stable predictions across adoption classes.


## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains organizational‑level information, including:
- Training hours provided
- Number of employees impacted
- New roles created
- Industry and country context
- Employee sentiment feedback
- Measured productivity change

Categorical variables are encoded, while numerical variables are standardized to ensure consistency across industries and regions.

## 🔄 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Key preprocessing steps include:

1. Missing value handling for employee feedback
2. Label encoding for categorical variables
3. Standardization of numerical features using StandardScaler
4. Sentiment score extraction using VADER sentiment analysis

A derived high_adoption label is created based on training intensity, productivity improvement, and positive sentiment.


## ⚖️ Feature Scaling Strategy

All numerical inputs are normalized during model training.
As a result:

- Inputs represent relative organizational intensity, not raw absolute values
- Predictions are robust across companies of different sizes and industries

This design choice improves generalization and prevents scale bias.


## 🖥 Interactive Streamlit Dashboard

The Streamlit application allows users to:

- Input organizational training and adoption parameters
- Enter qualitative employee feedback
- Instantly receive adoption probability and productivity predictions

The interface is designed for business users, analysts, and decision‑makers.

## 📈 Prediction Outputs

The system provides:

- High Adoption Probability (classification output)
- Predicted Productivity Change (scaled)
- Employee Sentiment Score

These outputs are interpreted together to reflect organizational readiness.


## 💡 Recommendation Engine

Based on adoption probability:

- Low adoption likelihood triggers recommendations such as additional training and change champions
- High adoption likelihood suggests scaling, automation, and advanced Copilot use cases

This bridges the gap between prediction and real‑world action.


## 🏗 System Architecture

The project consists of:

- A model training script for preprocessing, training, and saving models
- A Streamlit application for deployment and interaction
- Serialized models and feature metadata for consistent inference


## 📊 Sample Results & Model Interpretation

The following results demonstrate how the Copilot Adoption Intelligence System responds to different organizational scenarios by combining training intensity, workforce impact, role changes, and employee sentiment.

### 🔹 Scenario 1: Low Training & Negative Sentiment
Input:
- Training Hours Provided: 5
